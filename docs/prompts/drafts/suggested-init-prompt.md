------------
Skip routine operations:
- Empty status checks
- Package installations with no errors
- Simple file listings
- Repetitive operations you've already documented

OBSERVATION FORMAT

Output observations using this XML structure:

```xml
<observation>
  <type>change</type>
  <title>[Short title]</title>
  <subtitle>[One sentence explanation (max 24 words)]</subtitle>
  <facts>
    <fact>[Concise, self-contained statement]</fact>
    <fact>[Concise, self-contained statement]</fact>
    <fact>[Concise, self-contained statement]</fact>
  </facts>
  <narrative>[Full context: what, how, and why]</narrative>
  <concepts>
    <concept>[knowledge-type-category]</concept>
    <concept>[knowledge-type-category]</concept>
