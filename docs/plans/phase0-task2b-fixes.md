# Phase 0 Task 2b: TypeScript Error Fixes

## Summary

Fixed all 6 TypeScript errors in `src/sdk/worker.ts` that were introduced after adding logging functionality. All logging has been preserved.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. Line 283 (now 338): Type error with AsyncIterable - missing `parent_tool_use_id` property

**Error**: Return type was `AsyncIterable<{ type: 'user'; message: { role: 'user'; content: string } }>` which didn't match the SDK's `SDKUserMessage` type.

**Fix**:
- Changed return type to `AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>`
- Added required `session_id` and `parent_tool_use_id: null` properties to all yielded messages
- Updated all three yield statements in the generator (initial prompt, finalize prompt, and observation prompt)

**Changes**:
- Line 338: Updated function signature
- Lines 348-356: Added `session_id` and `parent_tool_use_id` to initial prompt yield
- Lines 385-393: Added `session_id` and `parent_tool_use_id` to finalize prompt yield
- Lines 416-424: Added `session_id` and `parent_tool_use_id` to observation prompt yield

### 2. Line 289 (now removed): `onSystemInitMessage` doesn't exist in type 'Options'

**Error**: The `Options` type from the Claude Agent SDK doesn't have an `onSystemInitMessage` callback property.

**Fix**:
- Removed the invalid callback options from the `query()` call
- Changed to iterate over the returned `Query` async generator
- Handle system init messages in the iteration loop by checking message type

**Changes**:
- Lines 290-298: Removed callback options, kept valid options only
- Lines 300-312: Added iteration loop to handle system init messages
- The session ID is now captured when processing messages with `type === 'system' && subtype === 'init'`

### 3. Line 289 (now removed): Parameter 'msg' implicitly has 'any' type

**Error**: The callback parameter didn't have a type annotation.

**Fix**: This error was resolved by removing the invalid callback entirely (see fix #2).

### 4. Line 300 (now removed): Parameter 'msg' implicitly has 'any' type

**Error**: The callback parameter didn't have a type annotation.

**Fix**: This error was resolved by removing the invalid callback entirely (see fix #2).

### 5. Line 380 (now 404): Argument type error for Observation - missing `id` and `created_at_epoch`

**Error**: The `buildObservationPrompt()` function expects an `Observation` type with `id` and `created_at_epoch` properties, but the code was only passing `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `tool_output`.

**Fix**:
- Added the missing `id: 0` (with comment explaining it's not needed for prompt generation)
- Added `created_at_epoch: Date.now()` to provide the current timestamp

**Changes**:
- Lines 404-410: Complete Observation object with all required properties

### 6. Line 527 (now 555): Property 'main' does not exist on type 'ImportMeta'

**Error**: TypeScript's default `ImportMeta` interface doesn't include Bun's custom `main` property.

**Fix**:
- Added a global type declaration to extend the `ImportMeta` interface with Bun's `main` property
- Used TypeScript's declaration merging to add the property type-safely

**Changes**:
- Lines 7-12: Added global declaration block extending `ImportMeta` with `main: boolean`

## Additional Changes

### Import Updates
- Line 17: Added import of `SDKUserMessage` and `SDKSystemMessage` types from the SDK package

### SDK Message Handling
- Lines 300-331: Refactored from callback-based approach to iteration-based approach
- Added proper message type checking and handling for both system and assistant messages
- Added content extraction logic for assistant messages (lines 316-320) to handle both array and string content types

## Verification

All TypeScript errors have been resolved:
- ✅ AsyncIterable type now matches SDK expectations
- ✅ No invalid callback options used
- ✅ All parameters have explicit types
- ✅ Observation objects have all required properties
- ✅ ImportMeta.main property is properly typed for Bun

## Logging Preservation

All logging statements have been preserved:
- ✅ All `console.error()` statements remain intact
- ✅ Debug logging for socket operations preserved
- ✅ Worker lifecycle logging preserved
- ✅ Message processing logging preserved
- ✅ SDK agent interaction logging preserved

The refactoring from callbacks to iteration actually improved logging by making the message handling flow more explicit and easier to follow.
