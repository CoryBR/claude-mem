# Phase 0 Task 1: Add Comprehensive Logging to Summary Hook

## Overview
Added comprehensive logging to the Stop hook (summary hook) to verify it fires on normal exit and successfully sends the FINALIZE message to the worker socket.

## Files Modified

### `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/src/hooks/summary.ts`
Added 8 logging points throughout the hook execution flow.

## Logging Points Added

All logs use the `[claude-mem summary]` prefix for easy searching and use `console.error()` to output to stderr (visible in terminal).

### 1. Hook Entry Point (Line 18-20)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Hook fired', {
  input: input ? { session_id: input.session_id, cwd: input.cwd } : null
});
```
**Purpose:** Confirms the hook was called by Claude Code and logs the input parameters.

### 2. Session Search (Line 34)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Searching for active SDK session', { session_id });
```
**Purpose:** Logs the session_id being searched for in the database.

### 3. Session Not Found (Line 43)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] No active SDK session found', { session_id });
```
**Purpose:** Logs when no active session is found (normal for non-SDK sessions).

### 4. Session Found (Line 48-52)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Active SDK session found', {
  session_id: session.id,
  collection_name: session.collection_name,
  worker_pid: session.worker_pid
});
```
**Purpose:** Logs when an active session is found with its details for verification.

### 5. Before Socket Send (Line 62-65)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Attempting to send FINALIZE message to worker socket', {
  socketPath,
  message
});
```
**Purpose:** Logs the socket path and message content before attempting connection.

### 6. Socket Connection Established (Line 68)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Socket connection established, sending message');
```
**Purpose:** Confirms successful socket connection before writing data.

### 7. Socket Error Handler (Line 75-79)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Socket error occurred', {
  error: err.message,
  code: (err as any).code,
  socketPath
});
```
**Purpose:** Logs detailed error information if socket connection fails (includes error code like ENOENT, ECONNREFUSED).

### 8. Socket Close Handler (Line 84)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Socket connection closed successfully');
```
**Purpose:** Confirms the socket connection closed cleanly after sending message.

### 9. Catch Block (Line 91-95)
```typescript
console.error('[claude-mem summary] Unexpected error in hook', {
  error: error.message,
  stack: error.stack,
  name: error.name
});
```
**Purpose:** Logs any unexpected errors with full stack trace for debugging.

## How to Test

### Basic Test (Normal Exit)
1. Start a Claude Code session in a project with claude-mem configured
2. Have a conversation that triggers SDK memory operations
3. Exit Claude Code normally (Ctrl+D or type "exit")
4. Check terminal stderr for log sequence:
   ```
   [claude-mem summary] Hook fired
   [claude-mem summary] Searching for active SDK session
   [claude-mem summary] Active SDK session found
   [claude-mem summary] Attempting to send FINALIZE message to worker socket
   [claude-mem summary] Socket connection established, sending message
   [claude-mem summary] Socket connection closed successfully
   ```

### Test Cases

#### Case 1: Normal Exit with Active Session
**Expected logs:**
1. Hook fired (with session_id and cwd)
2. Searching for active SDK session
3. Active SDK session found (with session details)
4. Attempting to send FINALIZE message (with socket path)
5. Socket connection established
6. Socket connection closed successfully

#### Case 2: Exit with No Active Session
**Expected logs:**
1. Hook fired
2. Searching for active SDK session
3. No active SDK session found

#### Case 3: Worker Socket Already Closed
**Expected logs:**
1. Hook fired
2. Searching for active SDK session
3. Active SDK session found
4. Attempting to send FINALIZE message
5. Socket error occurred (with ENOENT or ECONNREFUSED code)

#### Case 4: Database Error
**Expected logs:**
1. Hook fired
2. Searching for active SDK session
3. Unexpected error in hook (with stack trace)

### Log Filtering
To view only summary hook logs:
```bash
claude-code 2>&1 | grep "\[claude-mem summary\]"
```

## Behavior Guarantees

1. **No Breaking Changes:** All existing functionality remains identical
2. **Non-Blocking:** All errors are caught and logged but don't block Claude Code
3. **Clean Exit:** Hook always returns proper JSON response to Claude Code
4. **Searchable:** All logs use consistent `[claude-mem summary]` prefix

## Issues and Concerns

### None Discovered
- The existing error handling is robust
- All error paths properly log and exit gracefully
- No changes needed to logic, only observability added

### Potential Observations During Testing
- If socket errors are common, may indicate worker timing issues
- If "No active SDK session found" appears frequently, may indicate database query issues
- If hook never fires, indicates Claude Code hook registration problem
- If socket path is wrong, indicates paths.ts configuration issue

## Next Steps

After testing with these logs:
1. Verify hook fires on every Claude Code exit
2. Verify FINALIZE message reaches worker socket
3. Check for any unexpected error patterns
4. Use logs to diagnose any issues with worker finalization flow
