# Phase 0 Task 4 Summary: Pre-Test Diagnostics

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Task:** Verify logging changes and prepare end-to-end test plan

---

## Diagnostics Performed

### 1. Compiled Hook File Verification
Checked three compiled JavaScript files to verify logging survived the build process:

**Files Checked:**
- `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/scripts/hooks/summary-hook.js` (4.6K)
- `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/scripts/hooks/context-hook.js` (5.8K)
- `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/scripts/hooks/worker.js` (238K)

**Results:**
- summary-hook.js: Contains 3 instances of `[claude-mem summary]` logging
- context-hook.js: Contains 3 instances of `[claude-mem context]` logging
- worker.js: Contains multiple instances of `[claude-mem worker]` logging

**Status:** PASS - All logging statements are present in compiled files

### 2. Database State Analysis
Queried the claude-mem database to understand current state:

**Database Location:** `~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db`

**Findings:**
- Total SDK sessions recorded: 37
- Active sessions: 0
- Completed sessions: 22
- Failed sessions: 0 (inferred)
- Session summaries: 0

**Recent Sessions:**
```
ID 37: completed at 2025-10-16T21:39:18.888Z, project: claude-mem
ID 36: completed at 2025-10-16T21:24:30.850Z, project: claude-mem
ID 35: completed at 2025-10-16T21:11:12.929Z, project: claude-mem-test
ID 34: completed at 2025-10-16T20:59:43.438Z, project: claude-mem-test
ID 33: completed at 2025-10-16T20:55:15.426Z, project: claude-mem-test
```

**Database Tables Present:**
- diagnostics
- memories
- observations
- overviews
- schema_versions
- sdk_sessions (properly indexed)
- session_locks
- session_summaries
- sessions
- sqlite_sequence
- transcript_events

**Status:** Database structure is correct, but summary generation appears to have issues

### 3. Hooks Configuration Verification
Checked the Claude Code hooks configuration:

**Hooks File Location:** `/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/hooks/hooks.json`

**Configured Hooks:**
- SessionStart: Runs `context-hook.js` to inject previous session context
- UserPromptSubmit: Runs `new-hook.js` to create SDK session and spawn worker
- PostToolUse: Runs `save-hook.js` to record tool observations
- Stop: Runs `summary-hook.js` to finalize session and generate summary

**Status:** All hooks properly configured with appropriate timeouts

### 4. Worker Process Check
Checked for running worker processes and socket files:

**Commands Used:**
```bash
ps aux | grep claude-mem-worker | grep -v grep
ls -la /tmp/claude-mem-worker-*.sock
```

**Results:**
- No running worker processes detected
- No socket files found in /tmp/

**Status:** Clean slate - no zombie workers or stale sockets

### 5. Test Plan Creation
Created comprehensive test plan document at:
`/Users/alexnewman/Scripts/claude-mem/docs/plans/phase0-test-plan.md`

**Contents:**
- Pre-test checklist with current system state
- Step-by-step test execution instructions
- Expected log sequences for each component
- Log collection and filtering commands
- Success criteria checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

## Current State of the System

### Overall Health: READY FOR TESTING
The system is in a clean state with no active sessions or running workers. Logging is confirmed to be present in all compiled hook files.

### Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| summary-hook.js | READY | Logging present, executable, configured in hooks.json |
| context-hook.js | READY | Logging present, executable, configured in hooks.json |
| new-hook.js | READY | Executable, configured in hooks.json |
| save-hook.js | READY | Executable, configured in hooks.json |
| worker.js | READY | Logging present, executable |
| Database | READY | Clean, no active sessions |
| Worker processes | CLEAN | No running workers |
| Socket files | CLEAN | No stale sockets |
| Hooks configuration | READY | All lifecycle events properly configured |

### File Permissions
All hook files have execute permissions:
```
-rwxr-xr-x context-hook.js
-rwxr-xr-x new-hook.js
-rwxr-xr-x save-hook.js
-rwxr-xr-x summary-hook.js
-rwxr-xr-x worker.js
```

## Issues Found

### Critical Issue: Zero Summaries Despite Completed Sessions
**Severity:** HIGH
**Description:** The database shows 22 completed SDK sessions but 0 session_summaries. This suggests the summary generation pipeline may not be working correctly.

**Possible Causes:**
1. Worker may not be receiving FINALIZE messages
2. SDK agent may not be responding with expected XML format
3. Summary parsing may be failing silently
4. Database write may be failing

**Impact:** This is the core functionality we're testing - summaries must be generated for context to work

**Next Steps:** The end-to-end test will help diagnose where in the pipeline the failure occurs

### Minor Issue: Multiple Database Files
**Severity:** LOW
**Description:** Multiple database files found in ~/.claude-mem/:
- memories.db
- claude-mem.db
- index.db
- memory.db
- hooks.db

**Impact:** Potential confusion about which database is active. Code appears to use `~/.claude-mem/claude-mem.db`

**Recommendation:** Clean up old/unused database files after confirming current one is correct

## Logging Implementation Verification

### Summary Hook Logging
Located in compiled `summary-hook.js` at multiple points:
1. Hook entry point: "Hook fired"
2. Session search: "Searching for active SDK session"
3. Session found: "Active SDK session found"
4. Socket operations: "Attempting to send FINALIZE message", "Socket connection established"
5. Completion: "Socket connection closed successfully"

### Context Hook Logging
Located in compiled `context-hook.js` at multiple points:
1. Hook entry: "Hook fired with input:"
2. Source validation: "Source check passed"
3. Project extraction: "Extracted project name"
4. Database query: "Querying database for recent summaries..."
5. Results: "Database query complete - found X summaries"
6. Markdown generation: "Building markdown context from summaries..."
7. Completion: "Context hook completed successfully"

### Worker Logging
Located in compiled `worker.js` throughout the lifecycle:
1. Instance creation: "Worker instance created"
2. Session loading: "Session loaded successfully"
3. Socket server: "Socket server started successfully"
4. SDK agent: "Starting SDK agent", "SDK session initialized"
5. Message handling: "Message received from socket"
6. Summary parsing: "Summary parsed successfully", "Storing summary in database"
7. Cleanup: "Cleaning up worker resources"

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate: Run End-to-End Test
1. Follow the test plan in `phase0-test-plan.md`
2. Capture all logs (redirect stderr to file)
3. Pay special attention to summary generation
4. Verify each success criterion

### Priority: Investigate Summary Generation Failure
The zero summaries issue needs immediate attention:
1. Check if workers are being spawned by new-hook.js
2. Verify SDK agent responses include expected XML
3. Add more detailed logging in summary parsing
4. Check database write permissions and constraints

### Monitoring During Test
Watch these areas closely:
1. Worker process spawning (should happen in new-hook)
2. Socket creation in /tmp/
3. FINALIZE message delivery
4. Summary parsing and storage
5. Context injection in second session

### After Test
1. Document all findings from test execution
2. Collect and analyze all logs
3. Update code to fix any issues found
4. Consider adding automated tests
5. Update documentation based on learnings

## Conclusion

The system is ready for end-to-end testing. All logging has successfully survived the build process and is present in the compiled hook files. The database is in a clean state with no active sessions or zombie workers.

However, the zero summaries despite 22 completed sessions is a critical issue that the end-to-end test should help diagnose. The test plan provides detailed instructions for execution, log collection, and success verification.

**Status:** READY TO PROCEED with end-to-end testing

**Next Action:** Execute the test plan in `phase0-test-plan.md` and collect all logs for analysis
